*** pure+immutable debate ***

Functional Programming - naive f(g); phyil = Immutability + Pure Functions

Immutability
    - why?
        to ensure they don't change by accident in hidden dark places
        avoid temporal coupling
        do not pass mutable structures in deep complexity
    = an obj whose state cannot chage after its creted 
    - classes: plain java, Lombok, records, Immutables
    - "wither" vs best practices
    - collections: plain java, guava
    - local variables + parameters

Pure Functions
    - problems
    - definition
    - pure functions are NOT allowed to:
        -
    - why?
        - bugs
        - readability
        - tests
        - refactoring
    - debate: exceptions
    - debate: static
