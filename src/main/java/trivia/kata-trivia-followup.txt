- [easy] The max number of players must be changed to 6
- Add a new category of questions "Geography"
- The game must not start until all players are added. In other words, new players can't join after the game has started. 
- No two players can have the same name.
- [hard] After a wrong answer, a player only goes to Penalty box if they fail to answer a second question in the same category. In other words, he/she is given a 'second chance' from the same category.
- [hard] A streak is a consecutive sequence of correct answers for a given player. After providing 3 consecutive correct answers, a player earns 2 points with any subsequent correct answer. When a playerÂ gives a wrong answer: (a) if (s)he was on a streak, the streak ends OR (b) if there was no streak, the player goes to Penalty box. (In other words, with a running active streak a player does not go to Penalty box, but instead he/she looses the streak). In addition, the game should be won at a double amount of points.
